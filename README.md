# LoDB

I decided to create a program for management database—ã in Python. One weekend, I had nothing to do, so I decided to make a DBMS. It took about a week, and I decided to post my work on github.

# Python library
Only standard libraries are used.

# Not much documentation

- Creating a DB - CREAT DATABASE
- View the DB - SHOW DATABASE
- Delete DB - DROP DATABASE

# It is expected in the next version.

- Creating a table
- Add data to tables
- View data from tables

# P. S.
Sorry for my English
